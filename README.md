# BFH Resource Hub

The BFH Resource Hub is a website that aims to provide a curated list of practical links from my business IT studies at Berner Fachhochschule (BFH), which I frequently use in my work. It serves as a convenient reference and resource hub for various subjects and topics related to my field of study.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to compile and organize a collection of useful links that I have come across during my studies. These links cover a range of topics including python, sql, web development, data science and much more. It is organized in full courses, major subjects, literature, repositories, slides, and other resources. By centralizing these links in one place, I can easily access them whenever needed, saving time and effort.

## Usage

The website is designed to be simple and user-friendly. It provides categorized lists of links, making it easy to navigate and find relevant resources. Each link is accompanied by a brief description to provide context and assist in selecting the appropriate resource. Clicking on a link will open it in a new tab or window for seamless browsing. To access the website and explore the curated link list, visit the GitHub Pages:

Please note that a **login to the moodle platform** is required for most of the links.

## Contribution

This project is a personal endeavor, but contributions and suggestions are welcome. If you have any additional links or resources that you believe would be valuable to include, please feel free to submit a pull request. Together, we can expand and improve the resource hub to benefit the broader community.

## Changelog V2

Added hover functionality for tooltips: When hovering over a link, a tooltip now appears displaying a brief summary of the link. This enhancement required updates to both the JavaScript and CSS files. The JavaScript was modified to handle the hover events, display the tooltip text, and position the tooltip correctly. The CSS was updated to style the tooltip, ensuring it appears in a readable format and position. This feature enhances user experience by providing additional context without the need to click on the links.
